# How to Play Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a simple and fun two-player game. The objective of the game is to be the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal with your symbol. Follow the instructions below to learn how to play.

## Objective

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses "X," and the other uses "O." The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Setup

1. Draw an empty 3x3 grid on a piece of paper or use a Tic-Tac-Toe board if available.
2. Decide which player will be "X" and which will be "O." Typically, "X" goes first.

## Gameplay

1. The player using "X" makes the first move by marking an "X" in any empty cell on the grid.

2. The player using "O" takes their turn by marking an "O" in any empty cell.

3. Players take turns, one after the other, marking their respective symbols in empty cells.

4. The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:
   - One player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - The entire grid is filled with symbols, resulting in a tie (a draw).

## Winning the Game

The game is won if a player manages to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The first player to achieve this is declared the winner.

## Ending the Game

The game can end in one of the following ways:

- **Win**: When a player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game.

- **Draw (Tie)**: If all the cells on the grid are filled, and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw. In this case, neither player wins.

## Example:

Here's an example of a Tic-Tac-Toe game board:

```
  X | O | X
  O | X | O
  X | O | X
```

In this example, "X" has won the game with a diagonal row from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

## Play Again

After the game is finished, you can start a new game by erasing the grid and deciding which player goes first.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that is easy to learn and quick to play. Enjoy challenging your friends and family to this timeless game of strategy and skill.
